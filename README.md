# Information and Whatnot

You should only need GCC to compile this, as the source code is intended to only take place in a single C file.
It *might* work on Windows, but you *might* also have to do some fiddling to get it to work. This program is intended for use in Linux, after all.

Might also provide .deb, .rpm, and/or Arch PKGBUILD crap when the time comes.
